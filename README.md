SimpleDecompiler
================

My little Java Decompiler. Work in Progress, needs to actually get code from opcodes.
Not going to write much explanation, I have a lot of stuff running around in the Javadoc if you care. Currently, this can get all the fields, the access keywords (including static, volatile, etc.), package name, super classes, interfaces, method names and types, and Constructors.  Really, all that's left is parsing opcodes into actual Java. Which of course is the only thing anybody cares about.
